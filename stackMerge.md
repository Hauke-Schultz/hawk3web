# üèóÔ∏è StackMerge - Implementation Plan

## üéÆ Game Mechanics Overview

### Core Gameplay
**StackMerge** is a precision timing game where players build a tower by stacking moving blocks.

**How it works:**
1. A block moves horizontally back and forth on screen
2. Player taps/clicks to drop the block
3. If block aligns perfectly with previous block ‚Üí Perfect stack (block stays full size)
4. If block partially overlaps ‚Üí Only overlapping part continues (rest falls off)
5. If block misses completely ‚Üí Game Over
6. Each successful stack = +1 point
7. Goal: Stack as high as possible

### Difficulty Progression
- **Speed increases** as tower grows taller
- **Block size** can optionally decrease slightly
- **Movement distance** can increase at higher levels

### Level Structure (6 Levels + Endless)
- **Level 1-5:** Fixed target heights (e.g., 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 blocks)
- **Level 6:** Endless mode - stack until failure
- **Star Rating:** Based on perfect stacks percentage
    - ‚≠ê 1 Star: Complete level
    - ‚≠ê‚≠ê 2 Stars: 60%+ perfect stacks
    - ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê 3 Stars: 80%+ perfect stacks

### Special Features
- **Perfect Stack Combo:** Consecutive perfect stacks increase score multiplier
- **Color Progression:** Block colors change as tower grows (visual reward)
- **Camera Follow:** Viewport smoothly follows tower height
- **Physics-Free:** Pure timing/collision detection (no Matter.js needed)
